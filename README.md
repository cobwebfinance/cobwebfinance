Cobweb project has the similar mechanism to let you be notified for great investment opportunities. We allow different projects make access to our smart contract deployed on Ethereum, including cross-chain assets. Each user can create his own cobweb by simple operation through our website UI, and indicate the typies of bugs he desires to capture, which stands for the investment targets the user is looking for. Thus when such bug comes to our system, the corresponding cobwebs will be triggered. User gets alerted to review such investment opportunity, and can do investment instantly.
